# Minecraft
Clone of Minecraft in Rust using Bevy Engine

## How to run
1. Install Rust
2. Clone the repository
3. To run the game in local, run `cargo run --release`
   To run the web assembly version, install the wasm rust toolchain (`rustup target install wasm32-unknown-unknown`) then run `cargo run --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. You can then open http://127.0.0.1:1334 in your browser to play the game

## The repository
`master` branch is the development branch. `stable` branch is the stable branch (who would have guessed?)
